# Intro

This project was created after following some tutorials on flexbox and grid, and some other tutorials (from [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA?igno=re) Traversy Media) on html and css.

It's quite old video (2016), it doesn't use flexbox nor grid, but nice to see how it used to work.

Some small project idea to move elements on canvas by clicking buttons or you can also use arrow keys.
